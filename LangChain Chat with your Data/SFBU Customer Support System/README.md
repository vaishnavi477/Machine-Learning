# LangChain Chat with your Data: text - SFBU Customer Support System

This project demonstrates a Customer Support Chatbot built using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAIâ€™s GPT model and a vectorstore (Chroma) for efficient document retrieval. The chatbot is designed to answer questions based on the contents of uploaded documents, such as PDFs, with a conversational interface.

## Features

- Document Loading: Load PDF documents to create a vectorstore.
- Conversational Q&A: Engage in a conversational Q&A with the chatbot.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Uses similarity search to retrieve relevant document chunks to answer questions.
- Memory Support: Retains conversation history for context continuity.
- Web Interface: Uses Panel and Param for a simple web interface.
- File Upload: Upload a new PDF document dynamically for querying.
