# LangChain Chat with your Data

This repository integrates three interconnected projects that leverage OpenAI's GPT models and LangChain for creating an AI-powered conversational chatbot, a document-based retrieval system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a web-based interface for user interaction. The projects are designed to focus on various aspects of chatbot functionality, document querying, and an intuitive user interface to enable efficient querying and responses.
